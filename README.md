# Verification-of-RIS-based-wireless-communications-for-IMT-2030
Hi, everyone! Thank you for your interest in the V4M project. Here, we will provide complete information on prototype parameters, experimental setups, and measured results related with this project. In the following, I will briefly introduce the contents within each folder.
1) Folder "RIS-based antenna": In this folder, information on the implemented RIS-based antennas and corresponding communication prototypes are presented, respectively.
2) Folder "RIS-based relay": This folder contains information about the deployed prototype of RIS-based relay networks.
